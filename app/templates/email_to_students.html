Dear {{ fname }},
<br><br>
Thank you for volunteering for Open House. This is our opportunity to prove to accepted students why they should attend Stuyvesant.  Included in this email is important information, please read in its entirety.
<br><br>
On the day(s) that you are volunteering, please report to the <strong>first floor</strong> at <strong>4:00 PM</strong> where you will check in with organization leaders. After checking in, there will be a training session. Food will be provided before starting your tours. Make sure to check out with any organization leader before leaving at the conclusion of the event.
<br><br>
ARISTA members: If you have an approved excuse for Tuesday (which can be checked on openhouse.stuyarista.org under the information tab), you will be required to attend Wednesday, unless you have an approved excuse for both days. Big Sibs are required to volunteer on both days.
<br><br>
Finally, please wear appropriate attire, preferably Stuy apparel; do not wear cropped t-shirts or short shorts.
<br><br>
Please reach out your respective organization leaders if you have any questions. 
<br><br>
See you all tomorrow!
<br><br>
Best regards,
<br>
ARISTA Executive Council
